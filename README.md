Hello everybody

## What is GIT?

Git is a version control system (VCS) used to track changes to code or any other kind of text files. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has become the most widely used VCS for software development.

Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a single codebase, and track changes to code over time. Each change is tracked as a separate "commit" with a unique identifier, allowing developers to roll back to earlier versions of the code if necessary. Git also allows developers to work on different branches of the codebase, merging changes together when they are ready.

Git is typically used through a command-line interface, but there are also many graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available that make it easier to work with for those who are less familiar with the command line. Git can be hosted locally on a developer's machine, or on a remote server such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, allowing for distributed collaboration and backup of code.

## What Does git clone Do?

git clone https://github.com/github/training-kit.git
When you clone a repository, you don't get one file, like you may in other centralized version control systems. By cloning with Git, you get the entire repository - all files, all branches, and all commits.
